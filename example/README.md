## Tour of Heroes: Routing

Welcome to the example application used in AngularDart's
[Tour of Heroes: Routing](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular/tutorial/toh-pt5.html) page.

You can run a [hosted copy](http://angular-examples.github.io/toh-5) of this sample. Or run your own copy:

1. Clone or [download][] this repo.
2. Get the dependencies: `pub get`
3. Launch a development server: `pub serve`
4. In a browser, open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers,
you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
